# `minna-ui`

A friendly <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> framework which aims to be straightforward, intuitive, and high performance. It can be used as standalone CSS and web components or in a Svelte or other JavaScript framework project.

皆, みんな, or _minna_, is a Japanese adverb and verb meaning all, everyone, or everybody. It embodies the idea that through mindful attention to [universal design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) concepts the framework can work well for everybody; _everyone's UI_.

___NOTE: `minna-ui` is in early development. Before we reach v1.0.0, minor releases may contain breaking changes.___

## Overview

The `minna-ui` framework is designed around the types of projects we do at [We Are Genki](https://wearegenki.com) — ecommerce, microsites, and next-gen progressive web apps — but it's flexible so you can build any UI on the web. It aims to strike a balance between easy to use predefined styles, utilities for rapid prototyping, and opinionated but customizable web components.

Under the hood components use the Svelte JavaScript framework so `minna-ui` is a great match for your Svelte based projects. All components are also available precompiled for easy use in any web project regardless of which framework you use.

**Features:**

* Universal design as a core concept
* Semi-flat design aesthetic
* Microinteractions
* High performance

**Technologies:**

* [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) components
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org) powered CSS
* [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

## Documentation

## Browser compatibility
