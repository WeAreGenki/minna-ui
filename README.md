# Minna UI

üò∏ A fast, friendly, and fun web <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> kit for everyone.

A UI kit for building things with web technology which aims to be pragmatic, intuitive, and high performance. Simple to use as standalone CSS and web components. Supports advanced use in Svelte or any other JavaScript framework projects too.

ÁöÜ, „Åø„Çì„Å™, or _minna_, is a Japanese adverb and verb meaning all, everyone, or everybody. It embodies the idea that through mindful attention to [universal design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) concepts the framework can work well for everybody; _everyone's UI_.

**_NOTE: Minna UI is in early development. Before we reach v1.0.0, minor releases may contain breaking changes._**

## Overview

The Minna UI framework is designed around the types of projects we do at [We Are Genki](https://wearegenki.com) ‚Äî ecommerce, microsites, and next-gen progressive web apps ‚Äî but it's flexible so you can build any UI on the web. It aims to strike a balance between easy to use predefined styles, utilities for rapid prototyping, and opinionated but customisable web components.

Under the hood components use the Svelte JavaScript framework so Minna UI is a great match for your Svelte based projects. All components are also available precompiled for easy use in any web project regardless of which framework you use.

**Features:**

- Mindful attention to universal design principals
- Simple functional design aesthetic
- Microinteractions
- High performance

**Technologies:**

- [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) components
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org) powered CSS
- [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
